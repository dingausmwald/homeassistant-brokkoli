# Brokkoli Cannabis Management for Home Assistant

**The foundation of the Brokkoli Suite - Cannabis monitoring integration for Home Assistant**

A Home Assistant integration for monitoring cannabis plants with sensors and configurable thresholds. Part of the Brokkoli Suite for cannabis cultivation tracking.

## 🌱 Features

### Device-based Plant Management
- Cannabis plants as Home Assistant devices with grouped sensor entities
- Configurable thresholds for each sensor type
- Problem state when sensor values exceed limits
- Individual plant helpers: health status, growing phase, flowering duration
- Cycle system for grouping plants together

### Supported Sensors
- **Moisture**: Soil moisture percentage
- **Temperature**: Ambient temperature (°C/°F)
- **Light/Brightness**: Light intensity (lux)
- **Conductivity**: Soil conductivity (µS/cm)
- **pH**: Soil pH level
- **Humidity**: Air humidity percentage
- **Co2**: Air CO2 ppm
- **Power**: Power consumption monitoring
- **Daily Light Integral (DLI)**: Calculated from light sensors

### Seedfinder Integration
- Strain data fetching during setup
- Strain images and basic information
- Growth phase definitions

### Services & Configuration
- UI-based setup through config flow
- Various services to interact with plants
- Sensor changes directly in plant configuration
- Automation triggers for dynamic sensor switching (e.g., room changes)

## 🔧 Installation

### Prerequisites
For the complete Brokkoli Suite, install these complementary components:

- **[Brokkoli Card](https://github.com/dingausmwald/lovelace-brokkoli-card)** - Lovelace cards for cannabis visualization
- **[Seedfinder Integration](https://github.com/dingausmwald/homeassistant-seedfinder)** - Cannabis strain data and information

### HACS Installation (Recommended)

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-41BDF5.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

1. Add this repository as a [Custom Repository](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/) in HACS
2. Set the category to "Integration"
3. Click "Install" on the "Brokkoli Cannabis Management" card
4. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/plant/` directory to your `<config>/custom_components/` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Set up your first cannabis plant
1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Add Integration**
2. Search for "Plant" and select it
3. Follow the configuration flow to set up your cannabis plant
4. Assign your sensors (moisture, temperature, light, etc.)

### 2. Configure thresholds
- Each threshold (min/max values) becomes its own entity
- Adjust thresholds directly from the UI or via automations
- Changes take effect immediately without restart

### 3. Monitor and maintain
- View all cannabis plants under **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Devices**
- Check plant status and sensor readings
- Monitor problem states when sensor values exceed thresholds

## 📊 Sensor Management

Sensors can be changed directly in the plant's configuration interface or dynamically via automations when plants are moved between rooms.

## 🎨 Brokkoli Suite Integration

Brokkoli Cannabis Management is the foundation of the Brokkoli Suite:

### [Brokkoli Card](https://github.com/dingausmwald/lovelace-brokkoli-card)
- Individual cannabis plant cards
- Area cards for spatial plant arrangement
- List cards for tabular overview
- Interactive plant positioning

### [Seedfinder Integration](https://github.com/dingausmwald/homeassistant-seedfinder)
- Cannabis strain database access
- Strain data fetching during setup
- Strain imagery and basic information
- Growth phase definitions

## 🔧 Configuration

### Problem Detection
Customize which sensor violations trigger problem states:

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Plant Monitor**
2. Select your plant device
3. Click **Configure**
4. Choose which threshold violations should trigger alerts

### Strain Management
Update cannabis strain and refresh data from Seedfinder:

1. Go to cannabis plant device configuration
2. Enter the exact strain name (Seedfinder PID format)
3. Enable "Force refresh" to update all data including images
4. Strain changes take effect immediately

## 📱 Available Services

The integration provides various services to interact with your cannabis plants:

- `plant.replace_sensor` - Replace sensors for a plant
- `plant.create_plant` - Create a new plant
- `plant.remove_plant` - Remove a plant and all its entities
- `plant.clone_plant` - Create a clone/cutting of an existing plant
- `plant.create_cycle` - Create a new cycle for grouping plants
- `plant.remove_cycle` - Remove a cycle and all its entities
- `plant.move_to_cycle` - Move plants to a cycle or remove from cycle
- `plant.update_plant_attributes` - Update plant attributes and information
- `plant.move_to_area` - Move plants to different areas
- `plant.add_image` - Add images to plants
- `plant.change_position` - Change plant position coordinates
- `plant.export_plants` - Export plant configurations
- `plant.import_plants` - Import plant configurations

These services are integrated into the [Brokkoli Card](https://github.com/dingausmwald/lovelace-brokkoli-card) interface for convenient operation, or can be used directly in automations and scripts.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Sensor Values Not Updating
If old sensor values persist after cannabis plant reconfiguration:
- Use the `replace_sensor` service instead of removing/re-adding plants

### Strain Not Found
- Ensure exact strain name matching Seedfinder PID format
- Check that Seedfinder integration is properly configured
